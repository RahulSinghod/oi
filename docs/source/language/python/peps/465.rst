================================================================
PEP 465 -- A dedicated infix operator for matrix multiplication
================================================================

Abstract
=========

This PEP proposes a new binary operator to be used for matrix multiplication, called @. (Mnemonic: @ is * for mATrices.)


Specification
==============

A new binary operator is added to the Python language, together with the corresponding in-place version:

===  =========================  ========================
Op   Precedence/associativity	Methods
===  =========================  ========================
@    Same as *                  __matmul__, __rmatmul__
@=   n/a                        __imatmul__
===  =========================  ========================

No implementations of these methods are added to the builtin or standard library types. However, a number of projects have reached consensus on the recommended semantics for these operations; see `Intended usage details <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0465/#intended-usage-details>`_ below for details.

For details on how this operator will be implemented in CPython, see `Implementation details <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0465/#implementation-details>`_.
