Extended connectivity fingerprint
=================================

Extended connectivity fingerprint (ECFP) is generated by Morgan algorithm and a hash function.

ECFP is better at representing structure information than substructure-based fingerprints (e.g. para-substitution)

It has limitation that each atom invariant is located in specific integer by hash function, so it is less meaningful


==========
Algorithm
==========

**Morgan algorithm**

* Numbering invariant atom information into an initial atom identifier

* Identifiers are generated independently of previous identifiers and intermediate results are discarded

* The iteration process is continued until every atom identifier is unique


**ECFP algorithm**

* ECFP is based on Morgan algorithm, but its generation terminates after a predetermined number of iteration and keep intermediate results

* The collision is solved by hash function
