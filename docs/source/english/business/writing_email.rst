    Dear William Robson Schwartz,

    Hello, my name is Hyunwook kim and I am working at Korea National University of Transportation, Department of Software in Korea.
    I'm writing to ask about what I should write exactly in SSIG-SegPlate Database License Agreement.

    I thought that it is right to write like below in two parts which I should write information about my department:

    1. (hereinafter called END-USER), having its principal place of business at: Korea National University of Transportation, Department of Software, Korea
    2. Name (in capitals): Name of Department head
       Position: Department head
       Signature and Date:  Signature of department head

    I'm not sure that it is correct for this agreement.
    If there are any incorrect or missing parts, please let me know.

    Thank you for your time and consideration for this matter.

    Best regards,
    Hyunwook kim
