**Arthur Samuel (1959)**

The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed

**Tom Mitchel (1998)**

A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of task T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

====================
Supervised learning
====================

**Point**

    * “Right answers” are given

**Types**
    * Regression
    * Classification

**Regression**
    * Predict results within a continuous output
    * Map input variables to some continuous functions
    * Example: Housing price prediction

**Classification**
    * Predict results within a discrete output
    * Map input variables into discrete categories
    * Example: Breast cancer

======================
Unsupervised learning
======================

**Point**
    * Allow us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like
    * Derive the structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables
    * No feedback based on the prediction results

**Types**
    * Clustering
    * Non-clustering

**Clustering**
    * Find groups with patterns being close to each other
    * Example: Google news clustering

**Non-clustering**
    * Find the structure in a chaotic environment
    * Example: Cocktail party problem
