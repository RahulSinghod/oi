    Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead (`Wikipedia, Machine learning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning>`_).
