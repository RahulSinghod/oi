Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks (`Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning>`_).

I organize deep learning in various way using books, courses and so on and this is the table of contents.
