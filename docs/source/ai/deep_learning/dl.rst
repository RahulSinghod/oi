Deep learning
==============

Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks (Ref.: `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning>`_).

Here, I will introduce foundations of Deep Learning to understand how to build neural networks, and how to lead successful machine learning projects. Also, I will explain about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. Furthermore, I will show case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing.
