DrugBank
=========

A comprehensive, freely accessible, online database containing information on drugs and drug targets

A unique bioinformatics and cheminformatics resource that combines detailed drug data with comprehensive drug target information

Its extensive drug and drug-target data has enabled the discovery and repurposing of a number of existing drugs to treat rare and newly identified illnesses


==========
Overview
==========

**Drug type**

* Small molecule

  * Low molecular weight drugs (900 daltons) which are produced by chemical synthesis
  * These drugs have well defined structures and chemical properties

* Biotech

  * Drugs with a biological origin (manufactured in, extracted from, or semisynthesized from biological sources)


**Drug groups**

* Approved

  * A drug that has been approved in at least one jurisdiction, at some point in time

* Vet Approved

  * A drug that has been approved in at least one jurisdiction, at some point in time for the treatment of animals

* Nutraceutical

  * A drug that is a pharmaceutical-grade and standardized nutrient (with confirmed or unconfirmed health benefits)

* Illicit

  * A drug that is scheduled in at least one jurisdiction, at some point in time

* Withdrawn

  * A previously approved drug that has been withdrawn from the market in at least one jurisdiction, at some point in time

* Investigational

  * A drug that is in some phase of the drug approval process in at least one jurisdiction

* Experimental

  * A compound that has been shown experimentally to bind specific proteins in mammals, bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites


**Drug binding**

* Target

  * A protein, macromolecule, nucleic acid, or small molecule to which a given drug binds, resulting in an alteration of the normal function of the bound molecule and a desirable therapeutic effect

* Enzyme

  * A protein which catalyzes chemical reactions involving a given drug

* Transporter

  * A membrane bound protein which shuttles ions, small molecules or macromolecules across membranes, into cells or out of cells

* Carrier

  * A secreted protein which binds to drugs, carrying them to cell transporters, where they are moved into the cell
