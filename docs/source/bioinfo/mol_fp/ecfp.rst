Extended connectivity fingerprint
=================================

Extended connectivity fingerprint (ECFP) is generated by Morgan algorithm and a hash function based on :doc:`SMILES <smiles>`.

Algorithm
==========

Morgan algorithm
*****************

* Numbering invariant atom information into an initial atom identifier

* Identifiers are generated independently of previous identifiers and intermediate results are discarded

* The iteration process is continued until every atom identifier is unique


ECFP algorithm
***************

* ECFP is based on Morgan algorithm, but its generation terminates after a predetermined number of iteration and keep intermediate results

* The collision is solved by hash function


Pros and cons
=============

ECFP is better at representing structure information than substructure-based fingerprints (e.g. para-substitution)

It has limitation that each atom invariant is located in specific integer by hash function, so it is less meaningful
