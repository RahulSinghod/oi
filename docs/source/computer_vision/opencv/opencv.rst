In wikipedia (`Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCV>`_), OpenCV (Open source computer vision) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. Originally developed by Intel, it was later supported by Willow Garage then Itseez (which was later acquired by Intel). The library is cross-platform and free for use under the open-source BSD license.

I will organize OpenCV based on OpenCV courses produced by OpenCV (`Link <https://opencv.org/courses/>`_). This is a table of contents:
