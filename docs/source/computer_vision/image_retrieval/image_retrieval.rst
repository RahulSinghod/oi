Image retrieval
================

An image retrieval system is a computer system for browsing, searching and retrieving images from a large database of digital images. Most traditional and common methods of image retrieval utilize some method of adding metadata such as captioning, keywords, title or descriptions to the images so that retrieval can be performed over the annotation words [1].

Manual image annotation is time-consuming, laborious and expensive; to address this, there has been a large amount of research done on automatic image annotation. Additionally, the increase in social web applications and the semantic web have inspired the development of several web-based image annotation tools.

The first microcomputer-based image database retrieval system was developed at MIT, in the 1990s, by Banireddy Prasaad, Amar Gupta, Hoo-min Toong, and Stuart Madnick.

A 2008 survey article documented progresses after 2007 [2].


Search methods

Image search is a specialized data search used to find images. To search for images, a user may provide query terms such as keyword, image file/link, or click on some image, and the system will return images "similar" to the query. The similarity used for search criteria could be meta tags, color distribution in images, region/shape attributes, etc.

There are 3 main methods for image retrieval.

* Image meta search

    * Search of images based on associated metadata such as keywords, text, etc.

* Content-based image retrieval (CBIR)

    * The application of computer vision to the image retrieval.
    * CBIR aims at avoiding the use of textual descriptions and instead retrieves images based on similarities in their contents (textures, colors, shapes etc.) to a user-supplied query image or user-specified image features.
    * List of CBIR Engines

        * List of engines which search for images based image visual content such as color, texture, shape/object, etc.
        * Further information: Visual search engine and Reverse image search

* Image collection exploration

    * Search of images based on the use of novel exploration paradigms [3].
