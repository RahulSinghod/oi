Linear algebra
===============

Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning linear equations such as

.. rst-class:: centered

    :math:`{\displaystyle a_{1}x_{1}+\cdots +a_{n}x_{n}=b,}{\displaystyle a_{1}x_{1}+\cdots +a_{n}x_{n}=b,}`

linear functions such as

.. rst-class:: centered

    :math:`{\displaystyle (x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})\mapsto a_{1}x_{1}+\ldots +a_{n}x_{n},}{\displaystyle (x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})\mapsto a_{1}x_{1}+\ldots +a_{n}x_{n},}`

and their representations in vector spaces and through matrices (`Wikipedia, Linear algebra <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra>`_).

Here, I will introduce linear algebra contents for Machine Learing (ML) and this is the table of contents:
